Welcome to my portfolio, after some time out of the tech industry, it was time for me to get back to fully utilizing my potential as a developer. Take a look at my 
portfolio to potentially connect with me and get to know me as a developer! The portfolio itself is very modern and will scale as i grow as a developer. It uses higher 
order components as navigation along with fading animations to really have pop out it's features. This is just the front end portion of the entirety of 
the project. The backend is has it's separate repository as during the time of it's deployment, it was crated as a subdomain by accident. The technoligies used to develop
this amazing are:

• Designed and implemented SCSS styling.   
• Designed and implemented functional sanity backend to manage content.    
• Designed and implemented Navigation throughout portfolio with higher order components.  

Take a look at this beautiful portfolio and connect with me!
